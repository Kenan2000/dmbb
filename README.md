# Defense Mode but Better (DMBB)

### How to install the mod:

1. Extract **dmbb-master**.
3. Put _**dmbb-master**_ into the mod folder of CDDA.
4. Make sure you have installed these mods as well: _**TerrainBASEMOD**_ and _**Arcana**_.
5. Done. You can now select this mod in the mod loader.

### DMBB Dependecies

* **[TerrainBASEMOD](https://github.com/Kenan2000/TerrainBASE-Archery-Pneumatics)**
* **[Arcana](https://github.com/chaosvolt/cdda-arcana-mod)**


#### What's in the .zip file?
The contents of the .zip file is similar to the DMBB repository's files, but neatly organized. I can't upload folders at the moment, so it exists because of that.
